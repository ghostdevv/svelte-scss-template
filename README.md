# Svelte & Postcss
I wrote this template so I can easily impliment svelte, scss, and postcss together without having to rewrite it each time. It's based off the official [svelte template](https://github.com/sveltejs/template).

To create your new project [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):
```bash
npx degit ghostdevv/svelte-scss-template my-svelte-app
cd my-svelte-app
```

# Setup
```bash
cd my-svelte-app
npm install
```

# Commands
We use the commands provided with the official template

- ### Dev
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
- ### Build
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
- ### Start (uses sirv)
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

# Postcss Plugins
These are the postcss plugins we use

- ### Autoprefixer

# Got a suggestion?
Make a PR! I would love to expand the plugins and features this template uses
